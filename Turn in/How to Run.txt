Follow the general xampp setup process

Place the RAVE folder into the htdocs folder within the xampp folder
so your file structure should look something like this.
*/xampp/htdocs/RAVE/

To setup up the database 
	Go into the admin page for phpmyadmin - (127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin)
	Create a new database: name it 'edenbay'
		If you use a different name you'll have to change the name of the database in the dbconnection.php file in the php folder of the project
		
	Then run the script from the database script folder (import database)
		This will setup a database with 9 tables
		Run the script twice so you don't get any errors and all of the row are placed into the database
		
To utilize the user rights you will need to go to the add a user page in the site and create a new user with whatever rights you want to see
	If you don't want to see the different pages each user can access then don't change anything. The website will continue as if you logged in as an admin class user
		We have it this way because we hash the passwords the user puts into the database.
		In order to use the hashes we have to add user's through the website, we didn't find a way to pre-add users and still have the hashes work.
	
	This is the path for the page in the website.
		Admin Tasks/Add a User
	
	You will want to add an admin class user.
	
	We recommend doing this
		User: ADMIN
		Pass: ADMIN
		User: MECHANIC
		Pass: MECHANIC
		User: GENERAL
		Pass: GENERAL
		
		This will allow you to see all three classes of user and what they can access
		
	Once you have made the users go into the getuserrights.php in the php folder file and comment out 'echo admin' and uncomment 'echo $_SESSION["USER_RIGHTS"];'
	
	Once this is done the website will now query the database for the userrights based on your login.
	To reset your login just click the login button in the navbar 
	
To load the website
	make sure the phpmyadmin and apache services on running in xampp
	then go to one of these urls
		localhost/RAVE/login.php
		127.0.0.1/RAVE/login.php
	to login from a different computer: ip address(ipv4)/rave/login.php
		must be on the same network in order to connect to website.
